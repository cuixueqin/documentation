# ETLocal - Technical

Whether or not this will be a separate application or not must be decided on
15-02.

## Implementations

ETLocal will contain the following implementations:

- Implications for ETSource
- Control over git [?]
- Voting
- Discussion platform
- Authentication
- Authorization

### A dataset in ETLocal vs a dataset in ETSource

If an initializer input is removed from ETsource how does that reflect
in ETLocal or the module?

Must there be a difference?

So, if a dataset changes in ETLocal, must that change be visible inside of
ETSource? If so, when?

.. make a difference
.. show that the change has been live / beta -> how?
..

A dataset is created within a specified time-frame, for instance 2 weeks. After
that, the dataset is 'locked' from editing. Is that a good thing?

..

### Implications for ETSource

For editing the values of the initializer inputs a connection must be
present between ETSource and Atlas. Whether that'll be a minimal connection,
as just reading out the names of them, would be up to discussion.

### Control over GIT [?]

### Authentication

### Authorization

### Discussion platform

### Voting
